* Tasks

- Refactor =uri.html= so the 3 tables are not repeated as hardcode
- Rewrite code using =urllib2= to use =requests=
- Handle timeouts and other reasons why HTTP request for URL might be broken
- /page doesn't handle URIs with # in them, use POST method instead of GET
- Handle Content-Type: sometimes the page is returned as text/html or some other shit, which leads to error, instead of graceful degradation; try supplying http://launchpad.net/~sindikat
- http://prefix.cc
- List all URIs of the KB (do i need that?)
- Move from Graph to ConjunctiveGraph (or something Dataset)
- Serialize and parse TriX / Alternatively use persistence (Sleepycat)
- When loading RDF from outer sources, put them in a Named Graph, instead of lumping them together
- Manually add a triple (no Ajax at this point)
- Edit a triple
- Delete a triple
- Delete a named graph with all triples
- Unify two named graphs
- jQuery, Ajax, (possibly Backbone.js) - for in-place operation
- Refactor dirty =result_to_xss= function
- Manually create and populate named graphs
- Maintain versions of named graphs; specifically, put timestamp of last population from outer source
- Move from rdflib to Virtuoso (or Sesame)
